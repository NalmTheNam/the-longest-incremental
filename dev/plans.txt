PRESTIGE LAYER NAMES AND IDEAS:

*** LAYER 0 ***
All this layer content before extend is done.
(post-Extend content goes here -Meta)

*** LAYER 1 ***
All this layer content before extend is done.
(post-Extend content goes here -Meta)

*** LAYER 2 ***
IMPORTANT: We are making this layer, but we still need more idea.
WARNING: Darken is currently the longest layer planned yet!
oh man you have NO IDEA what's to come -Meta
I will make upgrade tree and the rest of layer 3's mechanics have even more content than the entirety of layer 2! :ae
At first Darken: Boost Points and Dark Energy based on Boosters.

Effects:
	* Add Booster Base. (up to +0.5x bc why not have scalings?)
	* Per-X building levels are closer to maximum.
	* Raise Dark Tonings' effects.
	* Reduce the Booster consumption.
	* Upgrade Resizers and Time Warps.

- (Aarex) Dark Recall
After Darkening, you will be able to get more resources based on DM gain.
These resources are only gained by having values over a specific set.
Darkening requires the product of 3 factors.
- Point Factor (b^log(x)^0.5)
- Booster Factor (b^x^0.5)
- Dark Factor (x)

Each factor contains its value:
- You can increase / decrease it. (0 - 10)
- BUT, it reduces a specific factor by an exponent.

Few resources have boosts.

- (Aarex) Resizers (Rebuild)
Raise points by an exponent.
However, it is limited by your maximum points in this Darken.
- The limit is reduced by an exponent too!
You can only use 1 per Booster.
And the exponent is adjustable.

- (Randomtuba) Time Warps
  * At some point, there will be long timewalls that are hard to get past
  * You can buy Time Warps with the main L2 currency
  * Using a Time Warp allows you to jump 6 hours forward in time (this could be extended)
  * Time Warps have a 60 second cooldown (or 5 minutes idk)
  * You can also use Time Warps to speed up time

- (Aarex) Dark Alloying
Many resources can be fused into higher-tier resources.
- But first, some resources can be converted into others.

- Challenges
-- (Aarex) I'm thinking about having multiple challenge choices to increase a level in a set.
-- (Randomtuba) maybe there could be 4 pairs of challenges, light and dark, that have the same goal but different nerf and reward, and you can only choose one
-- (Meta) customizable challenges could be post layer 2

(In order to transition to L3)
	* There's Elemental Essences, which you only gain one from all kinds.
	* There's Essence which requires a lot of Darken resources. (which muliplies L3 gain)

(post-Expansion content goes here -Meta)

*** LAYERS 3+ ***
- (downvoid) Upgrade Tree (L3, or maybe part of another layer?)
	* The 3D upgrade tree will start with having 6 branches, one for each element.
	* Each element boosts a different thing, so like air could boost points, fire could boost boosters, water could boost polishers, etc.
  * Oh, and each element has its own mechanic. :)
	* Light and Dark branches will be opposites, boosting 1 thing but nerfing something else. Buying 1 level of each upgrade will cancel each other out
	* Pure branches are 3 branches that will be unlocked later (maybe as an extend mechanic unlock?), and they do something (tbd)
  
- ASCENSION (L4):
  * Basically ascension from trollcremental
  * unlocked after Extend
  * Has both ascension upgrades and milestones
  * Yeah we'll figure this out later

- MINIGAMES (L4):
  (The power shouldn't be OP and should be optional.
    * The power should boost pre-Layer 4 content.
    * There are tiers based on how well you did: bronze, silver, gold, diamond, platinum, obsidian.
      * Higher tiers = more power.
      * Power is always logarithmic!
1. (by incremental_gamer) tetrational power tower game (basically base^^height)
  no, this is not inflation
  1.44^^Infinity = some real number
2. (Aarex's) balancing control (a game which automatically reduces / adds numbers. going out of bounds loses.)
3. (Aarex's) tetrational balancing (basically multiple dilated formulas stacked on one, and are upgraded by a single currency. +1 slog^0.75 -> x2 tetr points)
4. (Aarex's) rediscovery
  There are 3 modes:
    1. Expert Mode (buffs a feature)
    2. Time Trial
    3. Time Attacks (limited time)
  Your save will be retrived back on exiting.
  
- (Meta) Extend (Lâˆž)
  * This layer underpins all others, with heavily scaled requirements.
  * Extending resets EVERYTHING except the Extend layer itself. 
  * Each reset unlocks a new layer, expands all layers, and unlocks some boosts to speed up the early game.
    * And yes, I do mean expand ALL layers. All the way from layer 0 to the most recently unlocked one.
  * Unlocked at some point around L3-5, depending on how timewally the game is

TROLLING:
We do a lot of trolling
we could take some stuff from community incremental (the previous longest incremental)

STUFF WE CAN TAKE FROM COMMUNITY INCREMENTAL 2:
- Gifts (you can give giftboxes to developers [like cube tributes] that each give rewards)
(note: was never added but planned)
- Technobabble gaming

Achievements:
- Achievement tab appear at Layer 1.
