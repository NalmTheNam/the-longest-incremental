PRESTIGE LAYER NAMES AND IDEAS:

------------------------------------ *** LAYER 0 - MAIN *** ------------------------------------
All this layer content before extend is done.
(post-Extend content goes here -Meta)

- More point upgrades. It's really simple.
- 10 points: start with 1e10 points on booster/darken reset
-- balancing check: immediately get boosters and enhancements with that.

------------------------------------ *** LAYER 1 - BOOSTERS *** ------------------------------------
All this layer content before extend is done.
(post-Extend content goes here -Meta)

- (randomtuba) AUGMENTATION (EXTEND 1)
  * You can now "augment" your boosters to gain augmented boosters (kind of like consumption).
  ** You gain one augment booster per 1 booster.
  * Augmented boosters allow you to augment point upgrades, like how regular boosters allow you to enhance buildings.
  * Augmented upgrades have improved effects.
    -- Upgrade 1: Effect ^2
    -- Upgrade 2: Effect ^1.5 (cost inflation + softcap)
    -- Upgrade 3: Unlock super-boosters? (scales quadratically, boosts dark energy)
    -- Upgrade 4: Upgrade 2 has an even better formula.
    -- Upgrade 5: Makers produce more points based on Makers bought.
    -- Upgrade 6: All building production is multiplied by your total amount of boosters.
    -- Upgrade 7: Effect ^2
  * (Aarex) Might be Enhancements / Building Boosters, but to Point Upgrades instead.
    - Oh, you'll keep Augmentation in Lighten Mode.

- (downvoid) Super Boosters (Augmentation, Upgrade 3)
 * Super boosters increase the booster base.
 ** Adds effective Boosters instead if Boosters don't scale.
 * They can also be enhanced.
 * They will also have milestones that give even more QoL to the layers.

------------------------------------ *** LAYER 2 - DARKEN *** ------------------------------------
Dark Upgrades, Dark Recall, and Dark Alloying are done.
Do not add Post-Extend features in Layer 2. The layer is now finally completed.
Aarex will not tolerate this.

- (Consensus) Challenges
-- (Aarex) I'm thinking about having multiple challenge choices to increase a level in a set.
-- (Randomtuba) maybe there could be 4 pairs of challenges, light and dark, that have the same goal but different nerf and reward, and you can only choose one
--- (Aarex) Might come in Layer 3: Elemental or beyond.
--- Oh. Light / Dark Branches come from Upgrade Tree.
--- Might include Lighten Mode too. Anti-Darken, but different.
-- (Meta) customizable challenges could be post layer 2
-- (yyyy) agreed on meta's opinion
-- (incremental_gamer) maybe challenges that nerf things but unlock new mechanics?
--- (Aarex) Coming in Layer 4: Ascend.
--- (Aarex) I'll say new mechanics should be rewards.
-- (jwklong) im here to say im doin the challenge icons
-- (downvoid) There will be 5 challenges at the start, each having the nerf and reward listed in 3^3's message
-- (downvoid) C5's completion unlocks elemental essences and the Elements layer.

(In order to transition to L3)
	* There's Elemental Essences, which you only gain one from all kinds.
  * Elemental Essences boost specific element of a tree.
	* There's Essence which requires a lot of Darken resources. (which muliplies L3 gain)
  
------------------------------------ dark branch stuff ------------------------------------
(Dark Branch goes here)
- (Aarex) Dark Orbs
  * You can now separate resources into 2 resources.
  * Adjust your new resources to gain one, which multiplies respective requirements.
  * Dark Orbs multiply Elemental Essences.
  * There are no Special Orbs.
- (incremental_gamer) Dark Balance
  * You can adjust a slider which gives various nerfs and buffs
  * There are upgrades that can nerf the nerfs (and make new ones, blah blah blah)
  * It also generates "Balance Energy" based on the slider and also differs in concentration (equal to the "composition" of the left and right side of the slider, similar to a concentration of a liquid)
  * Unlocks a section where you can merge these concentrations to create new ones and then you can merge them together to get dark orbs and special orbs as well

------------------------------------ light branch stuff ------------------------------------
(Light Branch goes here)
- (Aarex) Lighten Mode
 * How?
    Point generation will be nerfed.
    Enhancements scale faster.
    Boosters scale instantly.
 * Replaces:
    Buildings, Boosters, Enhancements, and Elemental won't be replaced.
    Consumption is replaced with a different mechanic.
    Darken is transformed into Lighten with different gameplay.
      No Darken boosts are shared with the Light except with Space.
 * Toggling:
    All Lighten features only unlock as you progress in Lighten Mode.  
    Turning off Lighten Mode removes Lighten features, and readds Darken features.

Virtualization:
- With Boosters, you can virtualize for an extra Booster, Neutral Booster, and Anti-Booster.
- You can spend Anti-Boosters and other kind of Boosters for Theorems.
- These theorems can be putted into different "milestones," and you can respec them.

Lighten (Layer 2b):
- Lighten doesn't reset Neutral Boosters and Anti-Boosters.
- You will unlock Interelemental Upgrades which keeps upgrades in Darken mode.
 - Some upgrades are based on Neutral Boosters.

Transfusion:
- You'll be given a transfuser.
- Transfusers convert one resource into another.
- Merging Transfusers allow you to convert multiple into another.
- Having enough progress allows you to multiply Elemental Essences.
- You can even reverse it!

There won't be new Lighten Challenges and new Elemental Essences.

------------------------------------ post expansion stuff ------------------------------------
From the owner of Darken:
- Hey, zappies!
- The layer is now finally completed.
- No post-extend L2 features will be accepted.

For each Extend, you'll be given a new Recall Factor with a proficent resource.
- Thus, alloying with that resource will unlock new powerful resources.

Anyways, Aarex / Lightning's out!

------------------------------------ *** LAYER 3 - ELEMENTAL *** ------------------------------------
Going Elemental resets Darken entirely.
Yes, including Darken Unlocks, Dark Upgrades, and Dark Resources.

Elements are gained by going Elemental, multiplied by Elemental Essence.
(based on the logarithmic rate)
	* There are a total of 12 elements, each coming with a feature.
  * For each set of 6 elements, there is a upgrade tree.
  * The prestige resource for elemental will be called...
    - Fire: Runes.
    - Water: Potions.
    - Air: Possession.
    - Earth: The Planet
  * Part 2:
    - Light: Lighten Mode.
    - Dark: Dark Orbs.
  * Part 3:
    - Space: Soup.
    - Time: Lattices.
  * Post-Extend:
    Energy and Matter will be unlocked after 1st extend. Mana and Blood will be unlocked from Ascension.
    - Energy:
    - Matter: 
    - Mana:
    - Blood:
------------------------------------ The Upgrade Tree ------------------------------------
- (downvoid) Upgrade Tree (L3, or maybe part of another layer?)
  * These will be 3D coordinates.
  * Distance 1 boosts pre-Elemental, distance 2 unlocks a feature, and distance 3 improves it.
    -- For example, upgrade (2,0,0) unlocks Runes and upgrade (0,0,2) unlocks Lighten Mode.
    -- The position of each upgrade determines what it does. so like upgrade (1,1,0) is combining air with fire and will probably be a synergy between air's feature and fire's feature.
    -- Each upgrade (x,y,z) requires upgrades (x-1,y,z), (x,y-1,z), and (x,y,z-1) to buy. (unless one or more are 0, also replace -1 with +1 if it's negative)
  * There won't be upgrades beyond 3. (Total of 2 7*7*7 cubes of upgrades)
  * Elemental upgrades will cost their respective type of elemental essence.
    -- If an upgrade has more than one non-zero coordinate, it will cost both or all 3 of those essence types.
    
-- Branch Planning:
  -- First Set:
    - up: air
    - down: earth
    - left: water
    - right: fire
    - forward: light
    - backward: dark
  -- Second Set:
    - up: space
    - down: time
    - left: energy
    - right: matter
    - forward: mana
    - backward: blood
------------------------------------ Upgrade Planning ------------------------------------
There are too many upgrades.
Groups of (x,0,0) upgrades will recieve unique effects.
However, every one shouldn't be unique.
* Some upgrades will be the same. Like (1,2,3)(1,3,2)(2,1,3)etc, and (1,1,2) and (2,1,1), and (2,3,0) and (3,2,0)
* Instead of 343 unique upgrades per tree, there will now only be 171.

* any upgrade with 2 or more 0s in its coordinates will have a unique effect.
* any upgrade where all 3 numbers have the same absolute value will have a unique effect.

* Upgrade Tree 1:
(0,0,0): Unlock the Collider. (this costs 0 of each essence because all the coordinates are 0)
(1,0,0): Dark Energy gain is quadrupled.
(2,0,0): Unlock Runes.
(-1,0,0): Boosters are 5% more effective. (the base is raised to the 1.05)
(-2,0,0): Unlock Potions.
(0,1,0): Decrease all building scaling bases by 0.1
(0,2,0): Unlock Possession.
(0,-1,0): Double all non-alloy dark resource gain.
(0,-2,0): Unlock The Planet.
(0,0,1): Challenge requirements are divided by 100.
(0,0,2): Unlock Lighten Mode.
(0,0,-1): The 5th Dark Toning is ^2 as effective.
(0,0,-2): Unlock Dark Orbs.

------------------------------------ Collider ------------------------------------
Side-feature for (0,0,0).
- (randomtuba) Collider (L3)
  * (downvoid) Collider is unlocked when you buy the (0,0,0) upgrade.
  * You generate matter from points and antimatter from dark energy.
  * You can collide both to create annihilation energy and darker matter.
  * Annihilation Energy can be used to make the Collider more effective, and speed up production of other currencies outside of Collider
  -- (Aarex / Lightning)
   - Annihilation Energy isn't OP unless upgraded by Boosters with Upgrade Tree.
   - Initial Boosts: Booster Speed and Dark Resources
   - If Boosters are (scaled), add Booster Base.
  * Darker Matter can be used to purchase upgrades.
  -- (Aarex / Lightning)
   - Dark Toning 4 is always at max. (free Toning 1!)
   - Nerf Consumption's effect. (doesn't affect cost scaling)
   - Automate Dark Upgrades on Darken.
   - Automate Darken every 2 seconds, and passively get Dark Matter up to 5x lower than maximum gain.
   - Wiggle Ability: Wiggles Recall Factors and recalls every 2 seconds.
   - Multialloy Ability: Automatically alloy everything at 50% percentage.
   - If Boosters are (scaled), reduce Consumption scaling. (up to linear)
------------------------------------ Element Features ------------------------------------
We'll go over the features of every element before Extend.
- (downvoid) Fire: 
  * Unlocks Runes and Rune Sequences, which do stuff depending on the sequence.
  * You have a limited supply of rune slots, and you can only use rune types from the branches where you have unlocked that branch's feature.
  * Before you can use Runes you have to make them, which costs rune slots and the element's essence. Each rune costs 1 rune slot.
  * There will be a large list of sequences that work and what their effects will be. However, some will have negative effects.
  * Time and Space rune sequences are more powerful than sequences without them, but they have a higher chance of having a negative effect.
  * The longer the sequence, the higher the chance of it having no effect.
  * Rune sequences can be deactivated and they will be lost on deactivation.
- (downvoid) Water:
  * Potions can be crafted using water, elemental essence, and <insert thing here>.
  * tbd
- (downvoid) Air: 
  * Possession! I still need to figure out how we're gonna implement this into this game
- (downvoid) Earth: 
  * Unlocks new features
  * Can synergize with other resoures
  * The Planet: You must control a colony on a new planet and help them colonize the planet.
  * You will start out with some resources and you must keep the people alive to get resources from them.
  * The resources you collect can be used to upgrade the colony or boost other things
  * You can also buy more rune slots with resources. They can also do some other stuff but we'll figure that out when we get there
- (Aarex) Light: Lighten Mode
  * [See Lighten in L2]
- (downvoid) Dark: Dark Orbs
  * This will definitely be another mechanic in Darken.
  * [See Dark Orbs in L2]
- (Aarex) Space: Space Banking
  * Allows you to permanently bank a small portion of Dark / Light Resources, but decay over time.
  * Spending Soup will enable a Dark Upgrade in Lighten Mode and Light Upgrade in Darken Mode!
  * These banks are considered "pseudo-Virtual," due to abilites to keep in challenges.
  * (downvoid) Drinking the soup will give you a currency called knowledge, which will be used to improve rune usage, potion crafting, possession power, and colony growth.
- (downvoid) Time:
  * The Lattice is a place where you can hop to "alternate timelines", where each timeline has a different effect. There are infinitely many timelines.
  * The lattice is 2-dimensional. Timelines are numbered "a+bi",
  * The further you go from the center, the more extreme the nerfs in those timelines are, making them less useful.
  * however, if you get lucky you could find a timeline without nerfs, but those get more and more rare the further out you go
  * the effects can be almost anything, here are a few examples:
    - t1: This is the normal universe, there are no differences.
    - t2: Point gain is ^1.5, but you can't gain dark tonings
    - t100: Booster base is 1.2 but dark matter gain *10
    - t63: Dark Fuel is 3x stronger.
    - t42069: Point gain ^0.14, Time Crystal effect ^6
    - t(-1): All runes' effects are inverted.
    - t(2+i): Point gain is ^1.25, but you gain half as many dark tonings
    - (yes, all the imaginary timelines are altering the effects of the timeline without the i)
  * Imaginary numbered timelines will be unlocked at the 3rd upgrade in the time branch.
  * (these could make for good challenges)
  * Also once you change timelines, you force an Elemental reset.

(post-Expansion content goes here -Meta)

Yes. 4 more features to come.
It's either unlocked by extending or unlock new features from Ascension.

- (???) Energy:
  * ???
- (???) Matter:
  * ???
- (???) Mana:
  * ???
- (???) Blood:
  * ???

------------------------------------ *** EXTEND 1 *** ------------------------------------
- (Meta) Extend (L∞)
  * This layer underpins all others, with heavily scaled requirements.
  * Extending resets EVERYTHING except the Extend layer itself. 
  * Each reset unlocks a new layer, expands all layers, and unlocks some boosts to speed up the early game.
    * And yes, I do mean expand ALL layers. All the way from layer 0 to the most recently unlocked one.
  * Unlocked at the end of the Bug minigame.

  * (Consensus) Also, there's perks. You can choose one more Perk per Layer than last Extend.
  ** Layer 0 perks unlock at Extend 1 and Layer X perks unlock at Extend X.
  ** There's also "keep X" perks too!
  ** These do not subtract from other perks
------------------------------------ *** Layer 4 *** ------------------------------------
- ASCENSION (L4):
  * Basically ascension from trollcremental
  -- ASCENSION UPGRADES:
  Ascension Points can be used to buy Ascension Upgrades, and some of them can be charged with AP to have a greater impact (the ones with effects)
  -- TECHNOBABBLE GAMING:
  Based on your total AP, you generate Technobabble Gaming (TG), which pisses off scientists based on how many you have, which raises some ascension upgrade effects
  Pissed off scientists also unlock milestones (some have QoL, some unlock new mechanics)
    --- QUARK-GLUON:
    There are two currencies, quark-gluon plasma and quark-gluon gas. You can use the thermocharger to generate more/less of the two currencies.
    Quark-gluon plasma generates at higher temperature and boosts TG, quark-gluon gas generates at lower temperature and boosts main L4 currency gain
    --- SECONDARY PARTICLES:
    Based on your pissed off scientists, you generate Higgs fermions that boost quark-gluon effects
    You can also change the type of photons you have (6 types, up, down, top, bottom, charm, strange), each having different effects
    UP: boosts AP gain
    DOWN: raises point gain
    TOP: boosts higgs fermion gain
    BOTTOM: boosts TG gain
    CHARM: boosts quark-gluon gains
    STRANGE: boosts photon gain
  -- ASCENSION CHALLENGES:
  There are 8 Ascension Challenges. They can be completed up to TEN TIMES.
  Each first-time completion of an Ascension Challenge should unlock something significant.
  -- GIFTS:
  After unlocking this mechanic from an Ascension Upgrade, you can also gain giftboxes from Ascending!
  Giftboxes can be sacrificed to different developers, each one having a different effect.
  (downvoid) Gifts will boost or unlock new features in branches of the upgrade tree and elements.

------------------------------------ MINIGAMES ------------------------------------
Minigames:
  - Minigames are unlocked as a feature of L4. (except for bugs, those are unlocked earlier)
  - Bugs unlock at the end of L3, and others unlock at Ascension.

  - This will have its own tab.
  - Minigames boost pre-Ascension and Ascension.

  - NOTICE: THERE ARE TOO MANY MINIGAMES.
  - We will only consider some to implement.

1. (by incremental_gamer) tetrational power tower game (basically base^^height)
  no, this is not inflation
  1.44^^Infinity = some real number
2. (Aarex's) tetrational balancing (basically multiple dilated formulas stacked on one, and are upgraded by a single currency. +1 slog^0.75 -> x2 tetr points)
3. (randomtuba) replicanti 
4. (Aarex's) Lights out!
  You are a snake in a grid.
  There's lights you need to collect.
  There are different kinds of lights.
∞. (Consensus) Bug (unlocked at: end of L3 pre-extend, end of L4 post-extend, beat at least 1 minigame (increases by 1 per extend))
  - Unlike other minigames, this is not ranked.
  * (incremental_gamer) you gain bugs (side effect of features), anti-bugs, and features
  * you can reset features for updates
  * updates for games, games for money, and then spend it
  * however, you can increase your bug and anti-bugs gain
  * then your bug gain will explode and that's how the curruption is gotten
  - Progress in this minigame will depend partially on progress in other minigames.
  - You need other minigames to start gaining corruption - incremental_gamer.
  - There's an ominous progress bar that has the caption "n% to Corruption"
  - The screen gets more and more "glitched" as the minigame progresses.

  - When the percentage reaches 100%, the Extend meta-layer is unlocked.
  - Animation was chosen in #gameplay-discussion.

Not considered:
1. (inremental_gamer) incremental version game
  Empty yet.
2. (downvoid) Code Editor thing
  (Aarex) Just like Rune Sequences but harder.
  (downvoid) I don't even know how this would work.

Non-acceptable minigames:
1. (randomtuba) gwacremental (gwa comes every minute) 
  "wait what, we're actually adding the entirety of gwacremental as a minigame?" -downvoid
  (incremental_gamer) dumb question but what is gwacremental
  (Aarex's) Too complicated if we copy the whole game.
  (downvoid) I guess we could add --nevermind, that won't work.
2. (meta) lightning (type every dev's names as fast as possible)
  Typing isn't an aspect for incremental games.
3. (Aarex's) balancing control (a game which automatically reduces / adds numbers. going out of bounds loses.)
  Minigames are now a feature. Therefore, I don't allow this reflexing game.
4. (incremental_gamer) Recursion minigame.
  Point gain recursively multiplies itself.
  However, when you reach B_E limit, you can reset to log10 your gain but unlock new features (maybe for other games) (kinda like despacit tree and tetration)
  (downvoid) isn't this just the *exact* same thing as Inflation Tree Plus
  (downvoid) like when you reach Fe308 in the Inflation Tree Plus, you get to reset everything and log10 your point gain and add more layers/features/upgrades
  (incremental_gamer) yes but also i was thinking about prestreestuck and it's final layer
  we could borrow ideas from there
  (Aarex) Woah, woah. This breaks the purpose of Extend.

------------------------------------ *** ACHIEVEMENTS *** ------------------------------------
- Achievement tab appear at Layer 1.

id  name                               req                     effect (mostly additive ok)

(future achievements, number unknown)
??                                                             Above 2x, Timewarp Power speeds up Boosters instead.
??  Underachiever                      Go Elemental.           ^1.05 Points --this causes inflation without scalings ~ Aarex / Lightning --not anymore! -downvoid
??  Mediumachiever                     Unlock light and dark.  MAYBE
??  Insert Funny Reference Here        Unlock space and time.  MAYBE
??  A Bad Idea                         Extend.                 NO
??  Where's Infinity Point?            Go 1.798e308 points     NO
??  Side Story Proficiency             Reach gold or above in all minigames.
??  Master of Worlds                   Reach obsidian in all minigames.
??  Only the Beginning                 Extend twice.           NO
??  Third Time's the Charm             Extend three times.     NO

*** OPTIONAL FEATURES ***
- Rediscovery
 * Unlock this feature at Challenges.
 * Layer X Rediscovery unlocks at Layer X+1.
 * All Rediscoveries are progress points.
 * You can start a Rediscovery which disables layers beyond a specific layer.
 * When you finish a feature, you will exit with a trophy based on factors:
  1. Difficulty
  2. Speedrun
  3. Clicks
 * Exiting will re-enable all layers, and your progress will be recovered.
  * However, it perform a reset.

- Pre-Extend
 * Extend, but at a opposite direction.
 * Pre-Extend 1 should nerf things as we progress until Elemental, so we can reach Ascension.
 * You will unlock a layer before Darken.
 * However, scalings will be more severe!

 * (downvoid) maybe we could have this be a sub-feature of extend, like a set of challenges that you can enter whenever.
 * (downvoid) this would just be like ng-, ng--, ng-3, etc.
 * (Aarex) Yes. Extend N unlocks Pre-Extend N.
 * (Aarex) However, you won't reward anything.

- Difficulties
 * Self-explanation.
